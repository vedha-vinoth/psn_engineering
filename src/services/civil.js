       <p> Civil Engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and natural built environment, including works like bridges, roads, canals, dams and buildings. The Department of Civil Engineering started offering B.E programme in Civil Engineering in the year 2009 with an intake of 60. The B.E graduate program in Civil Engineering envisages providing students with a good understanding of Civil Engineering solutions in a global, societal and environmental context, consistent with the principles of sustainable development. The course will make the students capable in identifying, formulating and solving civil engineering problems that meet specified performance, cost, time, safety and other quality needs and objectives with professional and ethical responsibility. The course also gives importance to research based projects and to prepare students for teaching and further research, in addition to making them ready to satisfy current needs of the industry. The programs emphasise on industry and research based projects,</p>
