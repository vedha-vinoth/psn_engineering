  <h2>About The Department</h2>
<p>The institute offers four year degree course in Marine Engineering from the academic session 2003. Sailors and their legendary voyages have long fascinated storytellers and audiences alike. Marine engineers are modern sailors. And their jobs are just as exciting. They are responsible for the safe running of all engines, machinery and their maintenance, repair and construction. They also supervise engine crew involved in operating the machines. Application of modern technology has given a new dimension to the art of sailing worldwide. New management concepts such as decentralization and equity are altering the scope and feel of marine engineering in India too. Marine engineers, apart from Merchant Navy, also get employed in design, research, education & training and consultancy.</p>
